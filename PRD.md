Product Requirements Document: Sentinel AISubtitle: The Autonomous "Hype-Filter" Trading AgentVersion: 2.0 (Hackathon Edition)Target Network: Cronos EVMBusiness Model: x402 Performance-Based Fee1. Executive SummarySentinel AI is an intelligent trading agent that solves the biggest problem in retail crypto: separating "Alpha" from "Noise."While standard bots just trade price action, Sentinel AI uses Large Language Models (LLMs) via the Crypto.com AI Agent SDK to analyze market sentiment ("Hype"). It cross-references this social signal with real-time on-chain data (via MCP) to determine if a movement is a valid trend or a "Rug Pull" trap. It then autonomously executes buy/sell orders on VVS Finance, strictly adhering to user-defined risk profiles.The Winning Hook: Sentinel AI does not charge a subscription. It uses the x402 standard to programmatically take a "Success Fee" only when it generates a profit or prevents a loss, effectively aligning the agent's incentives with the user's.2. Problem StatementThe "Noise" Problem: Retail traders cannot process the thousands of tweets, Discord messages, and price ticks that happen every second. They often buy the "top" due to fake hype.The Speed Problem: By the time a human validates a "Hype" signal, the arbitrage bots have already moved the price.The Incentive Problem: Most trading bots charge monthly fees even if they lose the user's money.3. Solution: The "Sentinel" LoopSentinel AI operates on a continuous Investigate -> Filter -> Act loop:Investigate: Ingests market data (Price) and Sentiment data (News/Socials).Filter (The Core IP): Uses an LLM to score the "Truthfulness" of the hype.Example: "Token X is pumping 50%, but social sentiment is 'Bot Spam'. Verdict: NOISE (Do Not Buy)."Example: "Token Y is flat, but 'Smart Money' wallet mentions are rising. Verdict: SIGNAL (Accumulate)."Act: Executes the trade on Cronos EVM (VVS Finance) if the risk score allows.4. User Personas & Risk ProfilesThe user configures the Agent with one simple "Risk Slider":🛡️ The Guardian (Low Risk):Strategy: Only buys established tokens (CRO, USDC, WBTC).Hype Filter: Strict. Requires 90% confidence score.Stop Loss: Tight (-2%).⚔️ The Hunter (High Risk):Strategy: Chases meme coins and new VVS listings.Hype Filter: Loose. Buys on high volume/social spikes.Stop Loss: Wide (-15%).5. Technical Specifications (The "How")5.1 Architecture DiagramBrain: Crypto.com AI Agent SDK (Python/Node.js).Eyes (Data): Crypto.com Market Data MCP + Social Sentiment Scraper (Mocked for Hackathon or live API).Hands (Execution): Cronos EVM Smart Contract (Solidity).Payment: x402 Protocol Header Integration.5.2 The "Hype Filter" Algorithm (Crypto.com SDK)Input: Text streams (e.g., "CRO is going to the moon!", "VVS new farm launched").Processing:Python# Pseudo-code for Agent Logic
sentiment_score = analyze_sentiment(news_feed)
volume_trend = mcp_server.get_volume("CRO")

if (sentiment_score == "HIGH_HYPE" and volume_trend == "FLAT"):
    return "FAKE_PUMP" # Do not buy
elif (sentiment_score == "HIGH_HYPE" and volume_trend == "RISING"):
    return "VALID_BREAKOUT" # Execute Buy
5.3 The Execution Layer (VVS Finance Integration)Network: Cronos Mainnet Fork (Hardhat).Router: Interact with IUniswapV2Router02 (VVS is a Uniswap V2 fork).Logic:Agent calculates optimal entry.Agent checks UserRiskProfile in the smart contract.Agent sends transaction: swapExactTokensForTokens.5.4 The x402 Monetization LayerTrigger: When a position is closed.Calculation: Profit = ExitPrice - EntryPrice.Action: If Profit > 0, Agent constructs an x402 header request for 5% of the profit.Settlement: Smart contract automatically splits the final swap: 95% to User, 5% to Agent.6.

Revenue model is built on x402.EcosystemTrack 3Deep integration with VVS Finance (Cronos DEX) & Crypto.com MCP.7. Development Roadmap (3 Weeks)Week 1: The "Trader" (Foundation)Goal: A script that can swap CRO for USDC on a local Mainnet Fork of VVS.Task: Set up Hardhat Fork. Write Agent.sol (Smart Contract wallet). Test swaps.Week 2: The "Brain" (Intelligence)Goal: The Agent decides when to trade.Task: Integrate Crypto.com AI Agent SDK. Build the "Hype Filter" logic (even if using mock news data for the demo). Connect to MCP for price feeds.Week 3: The "Business" (x402 & UI)Goal: User Interface and Monetization.Task: Build the Dashboard (React/Antigravity). Implement x402 payment headers. Record the "Time Machine" demo showing the agent avoiding a crash.
